# Dalton Scrum Notes

## Week 5

This week I completed the coding for experiment 1 of my Dissertation (Woo!). I took some of this week to add the haptics functionality to that project for a related side project and began training my Undergrad RA to run that side project. 

### Goals:

- Have *Proposal* Date Scheduled
- Have RA fully trained to run haptics project independently
- Apply to present at ICPA (**02/15**)

### Other things going on:

- Statistics have been handed off to Emily for Agent vs. Environment Project
- Two events to organise for PEWS (Public Engagement with Science)
- Grievance Review Committee service likely to continue until April

## Week 6

This week has been a little slower, I met the ICPA deadline and have some progress with work on the PEWS projects. I was not able to meet with my RA yet to finish training and had some *proposal* based delays. 

### Goals:
- Actually have the *proposal* scheduled
- Have RA trained next week
- Have some of my Dissertaition Methodology (non-proposal) written out

### Other things going on:

- I am meeting with ISIC (Island Systems Integration Consortium) next week to help with a NSF project they have (PEWS)
- Working on getting my *resume* together to start applying for *jobs*
- In theory I should have a paper to review on my desk next week before submission

## Week 8

I have primarily been focussing on preparing my Dissertation proposal scheduled for Friday, but have also been working on finding ways to host and record data from an online Unity experiment. Based on research, using an AWS seems like it may be the most effective way to do this. Also I have had meetings with ISIC (Island Systems Integration Consortium), about work I will be doing with them for my PEWS course. Grievance review comittee work is also ongoing. 

### Goals:

- Have proposal complete
- Be ready to start data collection next week.
- Breathe?

## Week 9

I have completed my proposal (woo!), at least the verbal component. I have now sent out my written document with changes in relation to the feedback from the proposal - so fingers crossed that gets approved! 

I have also made a lot of progress on setting up a web based data stream for unity to allow for remote data collection - though it's not finished yet. 

I also very recently heard back from Motor Control about a submission that has been recommended for publication with minor revisions - so I can hopefully figure that out soon. 

### Goals:

- Add a function in my dissertation to collect the size of the aperture at the end of a reach, not just beginning. 
- Request SONA approval for my Dissertation.
- Complete web set up for Capstone Unity project
- Develop proposal for PEWS project to send to ISIC
- Do revisions on Motor Control submission

## Week 10 (NOTE Incoming Merge issue with Week 9)

I took spring break off as I was /this/ close to having a breakdown - and I'm still equally as stressed but hey I guess I can technically say I had a break. I am catching back up to my endless list of responsibilities so let's figure out where I am.

### Things that are done:

- Greivance Review Committee Service is over (as far as I am aware)
- Verbal Dissertation Proposal is done (though this is less meaningful than I originally thought)
- Online data collection system for Capstone (unless getting survey data is more of a problem than I expect)

### Things that are pending on others' input:

- Written Dissertation Proposal (Handed in prior to spring break, but may be done depending on severity of feedback)
- SONA Approval for Dissertation (Request submitted prior to spring break - awaiting approval)

### Goals

- Address response to Motor Control Manuscript and Re-submit by Friday.
- Meet with ISIC to discuss direction of Galapagos Research & Outreach Directory Project.
- Input last amendments into Dissertation project in Unity. 

## Week 12

Turns out last week was week 11, not week 10 - so that's fun! This week I have been working on some PEWS stuff and making tweaks to my dissertation - of which I'm having trouble with! I spoke to Kevin about freezing the size of the target aperture when participants initiate a reach, but this is a little harder than I thought it would be...

That being said, I seemingly have the go ahead to collect data and am planning to start next week !

I also got the Motor Control manuscript out and applied to some jobs.

### Goals:

- Attend Exponent Careers Event (Thursday)
- Fix aperture freezing issue (Ask trent for help?)
- Write 1 (2?) page abstract for Dissertation
- Speak to Paula about situations where I have to continue into Fall semester.
- Maybe speak to Tamara about working in Germany
