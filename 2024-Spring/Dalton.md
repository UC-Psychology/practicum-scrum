# Dalton Scrum Notes

## Week 5

This week I completed the coding for experiment 1 of my Dissertation (Woo!). I took some of this week to add the haptics functionality to that project for a related side project and began training my Undergrad RA to run that side project. 

### Goals:
- Have *Proposal* Date Scheduled
- Have RA fully trained to run haptics project independently
- Apply to present at ICPA (**02/15**)

### Other things going on:

- Statistics have been handed off to Emily for Agent vs. Environment Project
- Two events to organise for PEWS (Public Engagement with Science)
- Grievance Review Committee service likely to continue until April

## Week 8

I have primarily been focussing on preparing my Dissertation proposal scheduled for Friday, but have also been working on finding ways to host and record data from an online Unity experiment. Based on research, using an AWS seems like it may be the most effective way to do this. Also I have had meetings with ISIC (Island Systems Integration Consortium), about work I will be doing with them for my PEWS course. Grievance review comittee work is also ongoing. 

### Goals:

- Have proposal complete
- Be ready to start data collection next week.
- Breathe?
