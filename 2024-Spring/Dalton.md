# Dalton Scrum Notes

## Week 5

This week I completed the coding for experiment 1 of my Dissertation (Woo!). I took some of this week to add the haptics functionality to that project for a related side project and began training my Undergrad RA to run that side project. 

### Goals:

- Have *Proposal* Date Scheduled
- Have RA fully trained to run haptics project independently
- Apply to present at ICPA (**02/15**)

### Other things going on:

- Statistics have been handed off to Emily for Agent vs. Environment Project
- Two events to organise for PEWS (Public Engagement with Science)
- Grievance Review Committee service likely to continue until April

## Week 6

This week has been a little slower, I met the ICPA deadline and have some progress with work on the PEWS projects. I was not able to meet with my RA yet to finish training and had some *proposal* based delays. 

### Goals:
- Actually have the *proposal* scheduled
- Have RA trained next week
- Have some of my Dissertaition Methodology (non-proposal) written out

### Other things going on:

- I am meeting with ISIC (Island Systems Integration Consortium) next week to help with a NSF project they have (PEWS)
- Working on getting my *resume* together to start applying for *jobs*
- In theory I should have a paper to review on my desk next week before submission
