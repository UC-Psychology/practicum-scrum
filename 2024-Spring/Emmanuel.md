#Teaching #MQE 
## 2024-02-14
Got obsidian. Worked with chatgpt to help set up a detailed schedule for getting my MQE outline finished in the next four week. Also used Elicit to identify some lit to pre-review for the outline.

- Sent this update to my training committee
- Looking for ideas for an online, asynchronous course i am teaching this summer. Any helpful tools or workshops? 
- I really like Perusall as a collaborative tool ([https://www.perusall.com/](https://www.perusall.com/)), but will be looking for others…
- Signed up for this faculty development workshop on March 4th: Canvas Groups and Peer Review: Fostering Meaningful Student-to-Student Interaction
- Will be working on turning PGSA’s student experience survey. looking for good ways to present lots of data really succinctly

- [x] Will meet with accessibility tomorrow to make sure I can get everything i need for my MQE success!
- [x] Will start Saturday on my timeline (for outline/proposal)
- [x] Need to email my teaching mentor for the summer to get syllabus etc (DUE: 7-21-2024)
- [x] Need to set up Github stuff so i can do these notes in Github
## Next scrum: 2024-02-14

- Add in new ones
