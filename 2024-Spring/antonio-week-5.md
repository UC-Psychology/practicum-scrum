# Antonio's Week 5 Notes and Initial Goals!
So in this, I'm including my goals that I didn't put anywhere at the beginning of the semester and the scant updates I have regarding them.

## Goals
### 1. Figure out what catastrophe theory is
  - Why: to see if Jay and I's randomness product data fits in the cusp catastrophe model
  - Why: to later attempt a study with clinical populations using the cusp catastrophe model
### 2. Learn Matlab enough to code in it and translate the code to R and Python
  - Why: Jay uses Matlab and doesn't want to switch, because he has a lot of scripts already
  - Why: I use R and Python and don't want to switch, because I have a lot of scripts already
  - Why: R and Python are open source, with more documentation and easier use
### 3. Create a very basic first trial for my App/website idea
  - How: Learning basics of:
    - data scraping,
    - database management,
    - back-end web development (I do not have an eye for UX design)
  - Why: Career development, to help consumers in the jungle of consumerism, perhaps make side cash
### 4. Work on personal website, Github repository, portfolio, etc.
  - Why: I will not be a graduate student forever
### 5. Get a pilot study for Goal 1 up and running to eventually become my masters project

## Updates -- Week 5
### 1. Catastrophe
      - I still don't entirely understand it, but I found good introductory materials to read
      - Downloaded the R package
      - I need data to play with!!
### 2. Learning Matlab
      - Got code that computes spectral dispersions for time series data and computes fractal dimensions working (kind of)
      - Will be translating it into R this weekend
### 3. Startup
      - Meeting with computer science friend (just a BS) when I get back to Cincy to plan out goals
      - Please help me (open invite to anyone)
### 4. Career building
      - No updates, but learning Github
### 5. Pilot study
      - No updates

## Updates -- Week 9
### 1. Catastrophe Cusp 
      - Got two datasets from Jay I'm going to try to fit to the model
      - It is confirmed robust
### 2. "Startup" 
      - Still trying to figure out how to actually scrape data because it's going very poorly in the VS Code trenches
         - Essentially, I either can't get their server to accept my request despite using "headers" that impersonate a real user
         - EVEN IF THAT WORKS!!! I still get some other nonsense syntax error or everything runs fine, but it gives no output
      - Feel like I'm in over my head and I'm not even done with the first test
### 3. Making a study
      - I was mistaken when I said this was scrapped. Jay still wants me to put together a word priming reaction time study for quantum stuff
      - Just doing some literature review right now to put together a word list and figure out a control
### 4. Misc
      - I hope everyone had a good break
        - I put too much money on my credit card balance in Pittsburgh and bed rotted for a week in West Virginia
      - I cannot wait for employment and a 401k


## Updates -- Week 10?
### 1. Catastrophe Cusp
    - The data doesn't fit. Back to the drawing board.
    - May work on a Wiki tutorial for using the `cusp` package in R, but I'm confused about all the details of creating a Github document in Quarto.
### 2. "Startup"
    - No progress really. May wait until summer to work on data scraping, or choose a different product that is easier to create a proof of concept.
### 3. Making a study
    - Did some lit review. Found priming studies and word lists.
### 4. Misc
    - Just trying to stay swimming :)
