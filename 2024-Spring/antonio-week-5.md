# Antonio's Week 5 Notes and Initial Goals!
So in this, I'm including my goals that I didn't put anywhere at the beginning of the semester and the scant updates I have regarding them.

## Goals
### 1. Figure out what catastrophe theory is
  - Why: to see if Jay and I's randomness product data fits in the cusp catastrophe model
  - Why: to later attempt a study with clinical populations using the cusp catastrophe model
### 2. Learn Matlab enough to code in it and translate the code to R and Python
  - Why: Jay uses Matlab and doesn't want to switch, because he has a lot of scripts already
  - Why: I use R and Python and don't want to switch, because I have a lot of scripts already
  - Why: R and Python are open source, with more documentation and easier use
### 3. Create a very basic first trial for my App/website idea
  - How: Learning basics of:
    - data scraping,
    - database management,
    - back-end web development (I do not have an eye for UX design)
  - Why: Career development, to help consumers in the jungle of consumerism, perhaps make side cash
### 4. Work on personal website, Github repository, portfolio, etc.
  - Why: I will not be a graduate student forever
### 5. Get a pilot study for Goal 1 up and running to eventually become my masters project

## Updates -- Week 5
### 1. Catastrophe
  - I still don't entirely understand it, but I found good introductory materials to read
  - Downloaded the R package
  - I need data to play with!!
### 2. Learning Matlab
  - Got code that computes spectral dispersions for time series data and computes fractal dimensions working (kind of)
  - Will be translating it into R this weekend
### 3. Startup
  - Meeting with computer science friend (just a BS) when I get back to Cincy to plan out goals
  - Please help me (open invite to anyone)
### 4. Career building
  - No updates, but learning Github
### 5. Pilot study
  - No updates

# Week 9 Notes and Updates
### 1. Cusp Catastrophe
  - Have tested the cusp catastrophe model (the deterministic one) for robustness against noise
      - It is indeed robust
  - Jay is providing me with randomness production data to try and fit to the cusp model (and even see if that makes sense to do)

### 2. Matlab and R
  - I have continued making some progress in building R functions
      - Most of my work has gone into working on regression functions:
          - Hierarchical regression function
          - $R^2$ change and the significance of it
          - Power series
          - Variable selection
          - Quadratic and cubic fits
       
### 3. Website idea
  - Working on getting the spawn companies of evil corporations' (e.g., Nestle, Monsanto) mapped out into Excel
  - Going to meet with you next week to figure out this data scraping deal

### 4. Personal portfolio and website
  - In purgatory until this semester is over at least

### 5. Pilot study
  - Will be merging this into the Cusp Catastrophe updates, as it has become the same thing
  - Likely won't need to pilot any studies this semester unless another idea comes up or the randomness production data isn't fitting

### Personal updates :)
  - Need to go to class more often!
  - Successfully made bread pudding with vanilla sauce for the first time
  - Made a big antique bottle deal--most of my debt is in bottles
  - Going to Pittsburgh this weekend to see a buddy before he moves to the DMV
  - Hoping my silly website can make me rich enough to pretend this was a bad dream (jk)
  - Will be working on my writing for an Appalachian arts magazine
