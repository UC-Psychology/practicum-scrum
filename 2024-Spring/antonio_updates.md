# Antonio's Week 5 Notes and Initial Goals!
So in this, I'm including my goals that I didn't put anywhere at the beginning of the semester and the scant updates I have regarding them.

## Goals
### 1. Figure out what catastrophe theory is
  - Why: to see if Jay and I's randomness product data fits in the cusp catastrophe model
  - Why: to later attempt a study with clinical populations using the cusp catastrophe model
### 2. Learn Matlab enough to code in it and translate the code to R and Python
  - Why: Jay uses Matlab and doesn't want to switch, because he has a lot of scripts already
  - Why: I use R and Python and don't want to switch, because I have a lot of scripts already
  - Why: R and Python are open source, with more documentation and easier use
### 3. Create a very basic first trial for my App/website idea
  - How: Learning basics of:
    - data scraping,
    - database management,
    - back-end web development (I do not have an eye for UX design)
  - Why: Career development, to help consumers in the jungle of consumerism, perhaps make side cash
### 4. Work on personal website, Github repository, portfolio, etc.
  - Why: I will not be a graduate student forever
### 5. Get a pilot study for Goal 1 up and running to eventually become my masters project

## Updates -- Week 5
### 1. Catastrophe
      - I still don't entirely understand it, but I found good introductory materials to read
      - Downloaded the R package
      - I need data to play with!!
### 2. Learning Matlab
      - Got code that computes spectral dispersions for time series data and computes fractal dimensions working (kind of)
      - Will be translating it into R this weekend
### 3. Startup
      - Meeting with computer science friend (just a BS) when I get back to Cincy to plan out goals
      - Please help me (open invite to anyone)
### 4. Career building
      - No updates, but learning Github
### 5. Pilot study
      - No updates
