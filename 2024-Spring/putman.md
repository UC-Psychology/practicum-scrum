This week went better I got a decent amount of readings done although there is still a lot left and only 2 weeks to go. I decided to stop focusing on the books as much since I've already read a bit of them, and that has helped. Completed readings:
- Essay 4.2
- Reeves & Lin (2020)
- Beymer & Thomson (2015)
- Urdan & Kaplan (2020)
- Beymer et al. (2020)
- Nolen (2020)
- Otis et al. (2005)
- Fong et al. (2019)
