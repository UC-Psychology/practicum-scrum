This was the end of week 3 of readings, and things went rougher this week. There was unexpected life stuff that took up a lot of time and messed up my sleep, but I'm ready to get back on track this week. Here are the readings I completed:
- Ryan & Deci (2020)
- Iyenger & Lepper (2000)
- Essay 4.1
- Essay 4.2 (in-progress)
- Theory chapter 12 (in-progress)
- Reeves & Lin (2020) (in-progress)
